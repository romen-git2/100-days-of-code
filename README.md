This repository documents my journey through the **100 Days of Code** challenge, specifically focused on **Advanced Python, Agentic AI and Large Language Model (LLM) Orchestration**.

The curriculum follows a specialized roadmap covering everything from async Python basics to deploying multi-agent swarms on Kubernetes.

## 📚 Curriculum Overview

The challenge is divided into 7 key phases:

* **Phase 1 -** Advanced Python & Agent Tools (Days 1-10)
* **Phase 2 -** Agent Design Patterns & Integrations (Days 11-30)
* **Phase 3 -** Agent Framework Foundations (LangChain, AutoGen) (Days 31-50)
* **Phase 4 -** Advanced Frameworks & Multi-Agent Systems (Days 51-70)
* **Phase 5 -** MLOps & Deployment for Agents (Days 71-85)
* **Phase 6 -** Advanced Agentic Systems (Memory, Ethics, Planning) (Days 86-95)
* **Phase 7 -** Capstone & Optimization (Days 96-100)

## 🧠 Key Learnings & Reflections

* **Day 1 -** Learned that `asyncio` is critical for agents to perform non-blocking operations (like waiting for LLM tokens or API responses).
* **Day 2 -** Realized that filtering data effectively before an agent can make decisions based on history.
* **Day 3 -** Discovered that visualizing agent states (via Matplotlib) is essential for debugging "black box" behavior, allowing for quick identification of learning plateaus or erratic actions.
* **Day 4 -** Understood that LLMs are "frozen in time," so mastering web scraping (BeautifulSoup) is crucial for giving agents real-time context and access to live data sources.

## 💻 Tech Stack

* **Languages -** Python
* **Libraries -** `asyncio`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `aiohttp`, `matplotlib`, `beautifulsoup4`, `requests` (so far)
* **Frameworks (Upcoming) -** LangChain, AutoGen, LangGraph
