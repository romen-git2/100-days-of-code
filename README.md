This repository documents my journey through the **100 Days of Code** challenge, specifically focused on **Advanced Python, Agentic AI and Large Language Model (LLM) Orchestration**.

The curriculum follows a specialized roadmap covering everything from async Python basics to deploying multi-agent swarms on Kubernetes.

## 📚 Curriculum Overview

The challenge is divided into 7 key phases:

* **Phase 1 -** Advanced Python & Agent Tools (Days 1-10)
* **Phase 2 -** Agent Design Patterns & Integrations (Days 11-30)
* **Phase 3 -** Agent Framework Foundations (LangChain, AutoGen) (Days 31-50)
* **Phase 4 -** Advanced Frameworks & Multi-Agent Systems (Days 51-70)
* **Phase 5 -** MLOps & Deployment for Agents (Days 71-85)
* **Phase 6 -** Advanced Agentic Systems (Memory, Ethics, Planning) (Days 86-95)

## 🧠 Key Learnings & Reflections

* **Day 1 -** Learned that `asyncio` is critical for agents to perform non-blocking operations (like waiting for LLM tokens or API responses).
* **Day 2 -** Realized that filtering data effectively before an agent can make decisions based on history.
* **Day 3 -** Discovered that visualizing agent states (via Matplotlib) is essential for debugging "black box" behavior, allowing for quick identification of learning plateaus or erratic actions.
* **Day 4 -** Understood that LLMs are "frozen in time," so mastering web scraping (BeautifulSoup) is crucial for giving agents real-time context and access to live data sources.
* **Day 5 -** Learned that unlike scraping, APIs provide structured JSON data that is safer and more reliable for agents to parse and act upon.
* **Day 6 -** Recognized that robust agents require custom exception handling (try-except blocks) and structured logging to survive API failures and recover without crashing.
* **Day 7 -** Distinguished between concurrency (waiting) and parallelism (doing). Learned that parallel processing is essential for scaling agent simulations and running efficient batch evaluations across multiple CPU cores.
* **Day 8 -** Implemented the Strategy Pattern to decouple decision logic, allowing agents to dynamically switch between different problem-solving methods (like "fast keyword search" vs. "complex reasoning") at runtime.
* **Day 9 -** Built an ETL pipeline (Extract, Transform, Load) to sanitize messy input logs. Realized that agents need clean, structured data (like JSON records) to function reliably, reinforcing the "Garbage In, Garbage Out" principle.
* **Day 10 -** Validated that while LLM outputs vary, the underlying tool logic must be deterministic. Unit testing (Pytest) prevents regressions, ensuring that changes to the agent's code don't silently break its ability to parse commands or calculate results.
* **Day 11 -** Implemented the Factory Pattern to centralize the creation of specialized agents. Realized this pattern is crucial for multi-agent swarms, allowing a Manager agent to spawn specific sub-agents (Coder, Researcher) dynamically without knowing the complex construction details, ensuring high decoupling and scalability.
* **Day 12 -** Applied the Singleton Pattern to manage shared resources like configuration loaders. Understood that for heavy resources (database pools, global configs), enforcing a single instance prevents memory waste and synchronization errors in a multi-agent system.
* **Day 13 -** Implemented the Observer Pattern to enable real-time event broadcasting. By decoupling the agent (Subject) from its listeners (Loggers, Alerts), established an Event-Driven Architecture where the agent can simply "notify" changes without caring who is listening or how they handle the data.
* **Day 14 -** Mastered the Decorator Pattern to inject "middleware" logic (like timing, logging or retries) into agent functions. This allows for cleaner code by keeping business logic separate from operational concerns and enabling reusable behaviors across different tools.
* **Day 15 -** Implemented the Command Pattern to encapsulate agent actions as objects. This decoupling allows the agent to separate planning (building a queue of commands) from execution, enabling features like task batching, undo capability and clear audit logs for complex reasoning chains.
